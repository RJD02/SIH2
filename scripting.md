Hello everyone, I am Raviraj Dulange, from team Technology Managers
I'm here to demonstrate our team's idea, so let's begin

# Product Overview
The problem that we are aiming to solve is, dynamically control flow of sewage water and to gather data for better future planning
* our product is an IoT device, which will be installed on every manhole.
* So, let's start with the hardware part

## Hardware Part
The module that is going to be under every manhole is going to be protected by a construct big enough to store all our sensors and microcontrollers.
